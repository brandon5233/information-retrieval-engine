THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FINAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS

LIBRARIANS WERE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE MAIN FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR
CHOICE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AS A CAREER AND THEIR OPINIONS ON THE PROFESSION IN
RELATION TO TRAINING AND EDUCATION. 77 RESPONDED. 58 WERE 24-37 YEARS OLD; 59
WERE FEMALE; 68 HAD A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION; 49 CHOSE LIBRARIANSHIP AFTER THEY
FINISHED AT UNIVERSITY; MOST LANDED IN THE PROFESSION BY ACCIDENT; ALL
FAVOURED FURTHER PROFESSIONAL TRAINING (MOST PREFERRED TO GO ABROAD TO GAIN
WIDER EXPERIENCE AND ADSORB NEW IDEAS); 23 WOULD ADVISE THEIR CHILDREN TO BE
LIBRARIANS; 29 HAD PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS WHEN 1ST APPOINTED; 47 HAD
WORKED ONLY IN THEIR PRESENT LIBRARIES; AND MOST LIKED THEIR LIBRARIES BUT
EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH SALARY AND PROMOTION PROSPECTS.

FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION CODE.

THE FOUNDING OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION
SCIENCE (SAILIS) AS A NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATION HAS BEEN FAVOURABLY
RECEIVED NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. ITS STRUCTURE WILL BE DEVELOPED IN

FULL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERESTS AND REALISATION OF ASPIRATIONS OF EVERY GROUP IN

COMPUTERISED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL; AND THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF

LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.

COUNTY LIBRARIES' REGIONAL SERVICE-PROBLEMS AND LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STAGNATION, PARTLY DUE

DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION, AND A
RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME, NOW OVER 10 YEARS OLD, IS ATTEMPTING TO APPORTION
FUNCTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. COUNTY LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR TRIPLE TASK OF ADVISORY SERVICE,
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING, AND MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE, ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE. THESE SERVICES, WHICH BENEFIT PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIES
AND INDIVIDUAL READERS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SOME RATIONALISATION
PROPOSALS. THE FIRST 2 COULD BE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED IF COUNTY LIBRARIES
WERE MADE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ATTACHED TO LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. MOBILE
SERVICES ARE POORLY DEVELOPED IN NORWAY, PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS ARE
GEOGRAPHICALLY SUITABLE. A RESTRUCTURING OF TH E COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND COUNTY LIBRARIANS MUST EVALUATE THEIR OWN POSITION AND

LIBRARY SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGED: NOT QUITE WHAT THEY SEEM.

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, BATH 1980.
DISCUSSES THE STANDARD OF THE PROVISION MADE BY UK PUBLIC LIBRARIES FOR THE
DISADVANTAGED, AND ARGUES THAT, WHILST LIBRARIES HAVE LARGELY RESPONDED TO THE
NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTIONALLY DISADVANTAGED (EG HOSPITAL PATIENTS, THE
HANDICAPPED, AND PRISON INMATES), THE SOCIALLY AND CULTURALLY DISADVANTAGED
HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED. IDENTIFIES A BASIC DICHOTOMY WHICH HAS 2 ASPECTS:
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN LEVELS OF PROVISION FOR VARIOUS DISADVANTAGED GROUPS;
AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN SERVICE TO THE DISADVANTAGED AND SERVICE TO THE
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. REPORTS CRITICISMS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE INADEQUACY
OF THE WORK DONE BY LIBRARIES WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES, IN DEPRIVED AREAS, AND
WITH RELATION TO FUNCTIONAL LITERACY AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF READING.
STRESSES THE NEED FOR THE PROVISION OF COURSES ON, AND THE INITIATION OF
RESEARCH INTO, LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISADVANTAGED.

CAN THE LEAN YEARS GIVE CHILDREN'S LIBRARIES NEW OPPORTUNITIES?.

THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY'S MAIN TASKS REMAIN THOSE OF A CENTURY AGO:- TO
ENCOURAGE APTITUDES AND SKILLS, TO DISSEMINATE KNOWLEDGE, BOTH THROUGH FICTION
AND FACTUAL BOOKS, TO PROVIDE EXPERIENCE, WHETHER FROM INFORMATIVE
NON-FICTION, SATISFYING THE CHILD'S CURIOSITY, OR FROM FICTION, ALLOWING FOR
EMOTIONAL IDENTIFICATION, TO EDUCATE, ESPECIALLY IDEOLOGICALLY. SOME NORWEGIAN
COMMUNITIES STILL MAINTAIN STRICT ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS BOOK SELECTION
STANDARDS; LIBRARIANS MUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THEIR OWN SELECTION CRITERIA.
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS MUST PUBLICISE THEIR WORK AND PROBLEMS, COOPERATING
WHERE POSSIBLE WITH THE MASS MEDIA, AND MAKE THE 1980S A DECADE OF
OPPORTUNITY.

FUNCTION.

CONCLUSIONS FROM A SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE HELD AT
LEANGKOLLEN, NORWAY, JULY 80, INCLUDED THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S ALL-EMBRACING
FUNCTION; THE PRE-EMINENCE OF DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SCANDINAVIA; THE NEED
FOR NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE LIBRARY ACT; AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES' IMPORTANT ROLE IN SCANDINAVIAN CULTURAL COOPERATION. TOPICS
INCLUDED A FORWARD VIEW OF THE SCHOOL'S AIMS AND CURRICULUM; THE CHALLENGE OF

REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT 2 EXTRA PERMANENT STAFF AND
5 PART-TIME STAFF SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. THE SURVEY ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATION FOR

CONDITIONS AND CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE COORDINATION PROGRAMME AIMS AT, AND HAS PARTIALLY REALISED THE
INTEGRATION OF MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES INTO 28 LIBRARY COMPLEXES WITH
52 INDEPENDANT LIBRARY UNITS. ONE IMPORTANT MEASURE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A

REVENUE SHARING AND STATE FUNDING IN INDIANA: PROSPECTS IMPROVE FOR PUBLIC

IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
ABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE
PROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
ENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED
GOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR
OWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF
SENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED

MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

THE MICRO COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT UNIQUE, BUT JUST A SIMPLER VERSION OF THE
MINI AND MAINFRAME. IT IS ONLY CHEAPER BECAUSE LESS IS PROVIDED, THE
FACILITIES ARE INADEQUATE FOR MANY OPERATIONS, AND IF SIGNIFICANT ONCE-OFF
PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT IS REQUIRED, MOST COST ADVANTAGES OF A MICRO SYSTEM MAY
BE LOST. DISCUSSES QUESTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE RAISED WHEN CONSIDERING MICRO
COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LIBRARY AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION

HAVE ALSO BEEN ACTIVE AS PHILOSOPHERS. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LIBRARIAN AND
THE PHILOSOPHER MUST SHARE A NUMBER OF COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. THE MOST
STRIKING OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE UNBOUNDED THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE. IN
ADDITION, ALTHOUGH COURSES OF STUDY ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, THE

ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA
OF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS IS
NOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THE
ARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.

RESEARCH BEING PARTICULARLY CONCENTRATED ON AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE SPECIALISED RESEARCH INSTITUTES. SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION MUST BE SOUGHT IN LARGE GENERAL PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES, AND

PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES.

UNTIL WELL INTO THE 70S TRADITIONAL INFORMATION CHANNELS WERE USED WHEN
DEALING WITH INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL SCIENCES. THE EXPANSION OF RESEARCH IN
THE AREA NECESSITATED MORE PLANNED INFORMATION SERVICES. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT
OF THESES IS DUE TO THE LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES, TO THE SPECIAL NATURE OF

THEIR FIELD, TO THE UNWILLINGNESS OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TO USE INFORMATION
SERVICES, AND TO THE LACK OF STANDARDISED TERMINOLOGY IN THE FIELD.

INFORMATION COLLECTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CAN BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THE MORE MECHANICAL THIS EXCHANGE IS THE MORE ECONOMICAL
AND FASTER IT WILL BE. UNISIST NOW ALSO COVERS SOCIAL SCIENCES. A PLAN
PUBLISHED IN 1972 INCLUDES UNESCO'S PROGRAMME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION SERVICES IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. UNESCO ALSO SUPPORTS FINANCIALLY SOME
PROJECTS IN THE FIELD, INCLUDING ECSSID PROGRAMME. IN 1975 OECD MAPPED THE

(NOTE. ORIGINAL PRESENTATION IN FRENCH; ENGLISH VERSION PUBLISHED AT AUTHOR'S
REQUEST.) THE INTERNATIONAL POPULATION INFORMATION NETWORK (POPIN) IS BEING
ESTABLISHED IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH
INFORMATION, THE DESIRE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO BUILD THEIR OWN INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE NEED TO TIE TOGETHER ISOLATED ACTIVITIES TO MAXIMISE
BENEFITS. IT IS DEVELOPING AS A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL OPERATION WITH
ACTIVITIES INTEGRATED THROUGH A CENTRAL COORDINATING UNIT. THE 1ST MEETING OF
THE POPIN ADVISORY GROUP (SCHEDULED FOR EARLY 1980) WAS TO DISCUSS WAYS OF
IMPROVING INTERCONNECTIONS AMONG EXISTING POPULATION INFORMATION SYSTEMS;
RESOLVE PROBLEMS OF STANDARDISATION, UNIFORMITY, AND COORDINATION; AND REACH A

COMPUTER USE. THE ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE SMALLEST BINARY
CODE FOR A GRAPH AND REQUIRES GENERATION OF ALL NUMBERINGS FOR A STRUCTURE
WHICH WILL PRODUCE THE CANONICAL FORM FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX. THE UNIQUE
ADJACENCY MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE (BINARY) NUMBER
REPRESENTING THE STRUCTURE WHEN ITS ROWS ARE READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND FROM
LEFT TO RIGHT. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM IS ILLUSTRATED WITH A SELECTION OF
POLYCYCLIC STRUCTURES.

REGISTRATION-IDENTIFICATION OF CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS BASED ON LATTICE AND
EMPIRICAL FORMULA.

DATA FILES CONTAINING INFORMATION ON SOLID-STATE MATERIALS ARE EXPANDING
RAPIDLY. EACH YEAR SEVERAL THOUSAND NEW MATERIALS ARE CHARACTERISED BY X-RAY
DIFFRACTION TECHNIQUES. CONSEQUENTLY, COMPUTER PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED
TO REGISTER MATERIALS ENTERING LARGE DATA FILES. REGISTRATION BASED ON LATTICE
PARAMETERS AND EMPIRICAL FORMULA IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE. THE LATTICE IS
UNIQUELY REPRESENTED BY THE REDUCED CELL AND THE ELEMENTS IN THE FORMULA ARE
UNIQUELY SPECIFIED BY PRIME NUMBERS. THIS METHOD HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR SEVERAL
YEARS TO REGISTER NEW MATERIALS FOR THE CAMBRIDGE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC DATA FILE
WHICH CONTAINS DATA ON MORE THAN 25,000 COMPOUNDS CONTAINING ORGANIC CARBON.
THE METHOD IS NOW BEING ADAPTED TO REGISTER MATERIALS FOR THE NBS CRYSTAL DATA

INFORMATION AND LITERATURE DEMAND.

BETWEEN 1970 AND 78 THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL LITERATURE ORDERS RECEIVED FROM
OUTSIDE BY THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE IN COLOGNE INCREASED BY NEARLY 400%
TO 210,000. SINCE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION SERVICES EXPANDED CONSIDERABLY
DURING THIS PERIOD, THE LIBRARY NEEDED DETAILED INFORMATION ON REQUESTED
MATERIAL FOR FUTURE PLANNING, SO IN 1978 A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE
HELP OF THE DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (GERMAN RESEARCH ASSOCIATION).
INFORMATION FROM 12 LIBRARIES WAS OBTAINED ON THE SOURCES OF ORDERED
LITERATURE, THE USE OF MATERIAL BY DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL GROUPS, THE USE OF
COMPUTER SERVICES, BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTS, THE TYPES AND LANGUAGE OF
MATERIAL REQUIRED AND THE TYPE OF LIBRARY MAKING THE REQUEST. THE SURVEY'S
CENTRAL FINDING WAS THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPUTERISED INFORMATION
SERVICES CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCED USER DEMAND. LIBRARIES MUST CATER FOR THIS
AND THEIR FINANCING BODIES MUST SUPPORT THEM.

THE NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE AT THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
CENTRE PUBLISHED THE 1979 REPORT CONCERNING EXTERNAL LENDING AND BORROWING
STATISTICS. 175 LIBRARIES IN THE REGION WERE AUTHORISED LENDING LIBRARIES IN
1979. THE UNION CATALOGUE OFFICE SENT QUESTIONNAIRES TO 273 LIBRARIES,
DEPARTMENTS AND GRAMMAR SCHOOLS IN THE REGION. 270 OF THESE WERE COMPLETED AND
RETURNED. THE NUMBER OF INTER-LIBRARY LOANS LEVELLED OFF IN COMPARISON TO THE
HIGH 1976 FIGURES AND DROPPED IN SOME CASES. THERE WERE SOME EXCEPTIONS SUCH
AS THE COLOGNE ZENTRALBIBLIOTHEK DER MEDIZIN WHICH HAD A GROWTH RATE OF 13%.
THERE WAS A RISE IN BOOKS ORDERED BY LIBRARIES FROM OTHER LIBRARIES OF 3.7%. A
CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF BOOKS LENT TO OTHER LIBRARIES IN
WEST GERMANY AND ABROAD WAS EVIDENT. MORE BOOKS WERE BORROWED BY THE REGIONAL
LIBRARIES THAN WERE SUPPLIED BY THEM AND THE FIGURES FOR BOOKS SUPPLIED
DROPPED IN COMPARISON TO EARLIER STATISTICS.

ITS PILOT SURVEY. THE GROUP INCLUDED LIBRARIANS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF
LIBRARIES. THE PURPOSES OF THE PILOT WAS TO RECOMMEND THAT A COMPILATION OF A
SUBJECT HEADING LIST SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AND TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE WORK. THE LIST WOULD SERVE ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES AND
WOULD BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN A CLASSIFICATION. A THESAURUS STRUCTURE WOULD BE
BEST FOR THE PURPOSE. THE LIST SHOULD INCLUDE BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000 TERMS.
A WORKING GROUP SHOULD BE SET UP BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION THIS YEAR. THE
BUDGET FOR THE WORK LASTING 3 YEARS IS ESTIMATED AT 385,000 FINN MARKS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBJECT INDEX FOR THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.

IN MAY 80 THE JOINT WORKING PARTIES ON THE DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND THE
DUTCH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CENTRE PUBLISHED THEIR FINAL REPORT CONTAINING
PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN THE NETHERLANDS BASED ON BRINKMANN'S
CATALOGUE OF BOOKS. IN VIEW OF THE LIMITED NUMBER OF TERMS USED IN THE SUBJECT
INDEX OF BRINKMANN'S CATALOGUE IT WAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT THE THESAURUS OF
HEADINGS DEVELOPED BY THE NETHERLANDS BIBLIOTHEEK EN LEKTUUR CENTRUM (DUTCH
CENTRE FOR LIBRARIES AND LITERATURE) WITH THE ADDITION OF UDC AND SISO
CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS TO EACH ENTRY. A TEST-RUN HAS IDENTIFIED A CORE OF SOME
3,500 HEADINGS WHICH WILL BE INPUT INTO THE DATA BASE TO PROVIDE A SUBJECT
INDEX TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY. THE SYSTEM WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL ON 1 JAN 81.

LIBRARIES: CULTURAL ROLE AND THE PROBLEMS OF LIBRARIANSHIP.

CONSISTS OF PART OF K.I. RUBINSKII'S 1909 LECTURE AT KHARKOV UNIVERSITY.
LIBRARIES DESERVE SERIOUS STUDY AS FACTORS IN HUMAN CULTURE. THEY ARE A
COUNTRY'S MOST VALUABLE ASSET. LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSITY
SUBJECT AS IT EVOLVES THE BEST METHODS OF DISSEMINATING KNOWLEDGE.
LIBRARIANSHIP NEEDS TO STUDY THE WORK OF PEOPLE'S AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES,
LIBRARY HISTORY, STATISTICS, BOOK CONSERVATION, LIBRARY BUILDINGS AND STAFF
TRAINING. LIBRARIES MUST HELP ALL THOSE TURNING TO THEM AS A SCHOOL. HOWEVER,
UNTRAINED STAFF WILL HAMPER THIS. THE PEOPLE'S WAGES CREATED LIBRARIES, USE OF

FOR GOOD OR EVIL, LIBRARIANSHIP IS STERILE.

LIBRARIANS FAIL TO ATTRACT THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO THEIR RANKS; THEY ARE NEITHER
INVENTIVE NOR INNOVATIVE, THERE IS TOO LITTLE IN LIBRARIANSHIP TO JUSTIFY EVEN
A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
NOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN
LOGIC.

A SHORT REPORT WAS MADE ON THE SITUATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NORTH
RHINE-WESTPHALIA (NRW) ON 20 AUG 80 AT THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEETING OF THE
CITIES' ASSEMBLY OF NRW IN DUISBURG. A TOTAL OF 18 MILLION BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE
IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NRW FOR A POPULATION OF 17 MILLION. THIS DOES NOT
COMPARE WELL WITH FIGURES OF 5, 6 OR EVEN 8-10 BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION IN
OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE TARGET FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NRW IS 2 BOOKS
PER HEAD BUT EVEN THIS FIGURE WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IN THE FACE OF
RISING BOOK COSTS AND A STATIC ACQUISITION BUDGET. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL
NEW CENTRAL LIBRARIES IN THE LARGER TOWNS THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS UNEVENLY
DISTRIBUTED AND HARDLY EXISTS AT ALL IN SOME COUNTRY AREAS. THE LIBRARIANS
HAVE PUT FORWARD SUGGESTIONS FOR A LIBRARY LAW AIMED AT IMPROVING THE

PUBLISHED IN 1980 IN THE NETHERLANDS BY THE COMMITTEE FOR THE COORDINATION OF
STANDARDS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CONTAIN NO DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUND TO
THE SUGGESTED STANDARDS. SOME SECTIONS OF THE REPORT CONTAIN CONSIDERABLY
GREATER DETAIL THAN OTHERS, WHICH GIVES THE REPORT AN UNBALANCED APPEARANCE.
IT IS ALSO NOTEWORTHY THAT NO STANDARDS FOR STAFFING ARE INCLUDED. IN
COMPARISON WITH THE IFLA STANDARDS OF SERVICE AND THOSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE

HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THE LECTURES GIVEN SHOWED A GOOD THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
VERY OFTEN MORE ADVANCED THAN THE PRACTICAL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO THE

THE HANDICAPPED AND LIBRARIES.

THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF
AVAILABLE AIDS AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES. SOCIETY CREATES THE HANDICAP BY
MAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY
AND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVING
CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WAS
SHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONG
TEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THE
LIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATE
DOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS AND
PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.

MAKE LIBRARIES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!.

6 YEARS AFTER THE GOVERNMENT AGREED ON A NEW CULTURAL POLICY, NO PROPOSALS FOR
SUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FOR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN AND
PRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CAN
REACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECT
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACH
NEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIR
PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATE
LIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THE
BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH
MATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.

THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY

RUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYING
LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGER
ADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
AND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO
3767/1979 WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3 ROLES' SUPPLYING
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TO
THE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;

THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USER

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'
PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2)
AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4)
PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4 DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-A
DICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OF
USE AND 2-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2 DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1 USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;
TYPE 2-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202 RESIDENTS OF
SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THE
LIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TO
AWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSE
USE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.

LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.

THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY AND
EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANY
UNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATION

USER SATISFACTION IN THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY.

A USER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE HUGH STEPHENS COLLEGE LIBRARY TO DETERMINE
THE DEGREE OF USER SATISFACTION AND IDENTIFY LIMITING FACTORS. ANALYSIS OF
DATA FROM 203 DATA SHEETS COMPLETED BY PATRONS REQUESTING SPECIFIC TITLES
REVEALS THAT ACQUISITIONS BY THE LIBRARY AND USER ERROR ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT
LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGS
OF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE OR
SEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONS
POLICY. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF USER ERROR INDICATES A LACK OF ADEQUATE
LIBRARY SEARCHING TECHNIQUES, AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ASSISTANCE BE PROVIDED
FOR POTENTIAL USERS THROUGH SUCH MEANS AS LIBRARY ORIENTATION PROGRAMMES AND
SIGNS ALERTING THEM TO COMMONLY COMMITTED ERRORS OF THE LOCATION OF SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS. REPORT NOT AVAILABL E FROM NTIS.

SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.

ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSE
SCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALL
STANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APART
FROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS A
PERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE A
GREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATION
SOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIR
PRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATER
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFT
WORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES AND
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREA
OF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.

CRISIS-CENTRED, ISSUE-BASED' THE LONELINESS OF DISTANCE LEARNING.

ARGUES THAT UK LIBRARIES AND THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION CONTINUING

ADULT EDUCATION CLASSES DROPS AND BUDGET CUTS BITE DEEP EVERYWHERE, IT WOULD
BENEFIT BOTH ORGANISATIONS TO COOPERATE AND MAINTAIN A 'HIGH PROFILE'. FOR
THEIR PART, LIBRARIES SHOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES AS PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS IN
ADULT EDUCATION RATHER THAN AS SERVICING AGENTS; AGGRESSIVELY MARKET MATERIALS
ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUING EDUCATION SERIES; AND USE THEIR CLOSENESS TO THE
COMMUNITY TO ATTRACT AND SERVE THE WORKING CLASS. WITH ITS 4,500 OUTLETS, THE

REPORT ON A STUDY BY A SUSSEX JUNIOR-SCHOOL LIBRARIAN OF THE LIBRARY'S POLICY

MIDDLE SCHOOL ON THEIR READING INTERESTS. THIS PILOT STUDY ENABLED THE
LIBRARIAN TO ALTER THE RESEARCH DESIGN, NOTABLY BY PROMPTING INCREASED PUPIL
PARTICIPATION AND AN IMPROVED QUESTIONNAIRE. 258 CHILDREN IN THE AUTHOR'S OWN
SCHOOL TOOK A STANDARDISED COMPREHENSION TEST AND COMPLETED THE NEW
QUESTIONNAIRE. A PANEL OF CHILDREN CATALOGUED THE SCHOOL'S 4,793 BOOKS UNDER 2
MAIN CLASSIFICATIONS-FICTION AND INFORMATION, AND SORTED THEM INTO 50
CATEGORIES. DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS WERE TAPED. 1 IN 20 BOOKS WERE ASSESSED

PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK-TENDENCIES AND EXPECTATIONS.

THE STANDARD OF LIBRARY PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK IN WEST GERMANY IS OFTEN
CONSIDERED TO BE LOWER THAN THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES. INCREASING FINANCIAL
PROBLEMS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SOON MAKE THE LIBRARIES' TASK OF KEEPING UP
WITH MEDIA INDUSTRY TRENDS MORE DIFFICULT. IF PUBLIC LIBRARIES STILL WISH TO
BE REGARDED AS THE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTEMPORARY WORK WITH
CULTURAL MEDIA, THEY MUST PROVIDE BETTER PUBLICITY. EACH LIBRARY HAS
INDIVIDUAL FEATURES WHICH CAN PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.
LIBRARIANS MUST ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS, WHO WILL THEN SUPPORT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE LIBRARY,
RESULTING IN LESS EXPENDITURE FOR THE LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE A
'CULTURAL AGENT PROVOCATEUR', ORGANISING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES NOT ONLY TO

TEXT OF A DISCUSSION WITH COUNCILLORS INVOLVED IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC
LIBRARY SERVICES IN 3 LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE COUNCILLOR
FROM RIJSWIJK, WHERE CHARGES FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP WERE ABOLISHED ON 1
JAN 74, POINTED OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED BORROWERS HAD RISEN FROM
12,907 IN 1973 TO 21,183 IN 1974. HOWEVER, THE GROWTH IN MEMBERSHIP FIGURES
HAD LED TO INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE EXISTING SERVICES WITH THE RESULT THAT IT
HAD BECOME NECESSARY TO REDUCE LIBRARY OPENING HOURS FROM 47 1/2 HOURS TO 29
1/2 HOURS PER WEEK. THE UITHOORN AND HEERHUGOWAARD COUNCILLORS DEFENDED THE
POLICY OF THEIR LOCAL COUNCILS IN MAINTAINING CHARGES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THEY
WERE NOT EXCESSIVE.

DEMANDS FROM THE READERS. THUS THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES PROFESSIONALLY
STAFFED IS STEADILY RISING AND AT PRESENT IS 4 TIMES HIGHER COMPARED TO 1957

IN SERVICE TRAINING COURSES FOR VOLUNTARY WORKERS.

IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA FROM A TOTAL OF MORE THAN 1,100 PUBLIC LIBRARIES, ABOUT
950 ARE STAFFED BY PART-TIME LIBRARIANS. THEY WORK ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS MAINLY
IN THE VILLAGES. ON AVERAGE 50% ARE TEACHERS FROM LOCAL SCHOOLS. IN SPITE OF
THEIR DEDICATION AND HARD WORK, THE VOLUNTEERS OFTEN LACKED THE NECESSARY
KNOWLEDGE OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE. FOR THAT REASON,
REGULATIONS, ISSUED BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF CULTURE IN 1976, IMPOSED THE
DUTY ON DISTRICT LIBRARIES TO MAKE PROVISIONS FOR IN-SERVICE TRAINING OF THE
SAID LIBRARIANS, RANGING FROM 8 TO 24 HOURS PER YEAR. SO FAR, THE SYLLABUSES
OF SUCH SHORT COURSES AS WELL AS TEACHING METHODS HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY. IN
ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS AND ROLE PLAYING, FOR
INSTANCE, ARE TO BE USED MORE WIDELY. MORE PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH SLOVAK
AND FOREIGN LITERATURE (BELLES-LETTRES, FICTION) AND ALSO A GREATER INSIGHT
INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ADULTS WILL NO DOUBT,  EXERCISE FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE ON
THE LIBRARIAN'S PERFORMANCE, WHICH, IN TURN, WILL RESULT IN EXPANSION OF THE

CENTRES ARE IN THE POSITION TO EVALUATE THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL POTENTIAL
OF R & D GROUPS AND TO FORECAST LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND EXPENDITURE CONNECTED
WITH NEW PROJECTS. SUCH EVALUATIONS MUST BE BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF LITERATURE
DATA, INVENTIONS AND TECHNICAL REPORTS; THE RANGE OF THE DOCUMENTATION COVERED
BY THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE.

FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SERVICE PROVIDED BY A LIBRARY.

DESCRIBES THE METHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES USED BY THE STATE SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL LIBRARY OF LITHUANIAN SSR FOR PROVISION OF FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
SERVICES. THE SOURCES OF FACTOGRAPHIC INFORMATION INCLUDE MAINLY TRADE
LITERATURE, STANDARDS AND PATENT DOCUMENTATION. BECAUSE NOT ALL FACTOGRAPHIC
ENQUIRIES CAN BE ANSWERED FROM SOURCES HELD BY THE LIBRARY, THE LIBRARY
COOPERATES CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR PATENT
INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL AND ECONOMICAL RESEARCH, WITH THE ALL-UNION
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION, CLASSIFICATION AND
COORDINATION AND WITH A NUMBER OF SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL LIBRARIES
IN THE USSR AND IN OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES.

BETWEEN GIN AND TWIN' MEETING THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE THIRD WORLD.

AGREEMENT WAS REACHED AT THE UN CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR
DEVELOPMENT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GLOBAL INFORMATION NETWORK (GIN).
HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LACK OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE INDUSTRIALISED
COUNTRIES AND ABSENCE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, GIN IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A PAPER
AGREEMENT. EVEN IF IT WERE ESTABLISHED, IT WOULD DO LITTLE TO FULFIL THE REAL
SCIENCE INFORMATION NEEDS OF THE THIRD WORLD. A BETTER ALTERNATIVE FOR
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WOULD BE TO SHARE LOCALLY PRODUCED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
INFORMATION AMONGST THEMSELVES AND DEVELOP TWIN (A THIRD WORLD INFORMATION
NETWORK) TO MEET THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE INDICATIONS
THAT SUCH A SYSTEM IS RANDOMLY EVOLVING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

DISCUSSION ABOUT OR APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS HINDERED BY PEOPLE'S
ATTITUDES TO IT, RANGING FROM THE OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC TO THE PROFOUNDLY
SUSPICIOUS. MEN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY COMPUTERS, SO THE HUMAN FACTOR
IN TECHNOLOGY IS NEGLECTED. DATA BASES MUST, HOWEVER, BE ORIENTED TOWARDS
MAN'S NEEDS, AND DIALOGUE SYSTEMS ARE MEANT FOR MACHINES AND MEN; HUMAN
INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN MACHINES AND USERS WILL BE NEEDED FOR A LONG TIME. ALL
SCIENTISTS SEARCH THEIR OWN STOCK OF INFORMATION BEFORE USING OTHER SOURCES;
AT PRESENT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN OR ANALYSIS OF THESE SMALL, INFORMAL
STOCKS. CONNECTION OF LARGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
SYSTEMS WOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN COMPONENTS. THE INFORMAL HUMAN
EXCHANGE OF OPINION AND THE HUMAN BRAIN'S ABILITY TO CREATE CROSS-CONNECTIONS

EVERYONE WHO WISHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN MUSICAL RECORDINGS OF INTEREST TO
THEM AND RELATED REFERENCE MATERIAL. BUT SOME READERS NEED QUALIFIED
SPECIALIST HELP. MOST PEOPLE VISIT THE MUSIC LIBRARY HOPING TO FIND SOME SORT
OF CLUB. LIBRARIANS MUST ESTIMATE WHICH RESOURCES WOULD ACHIEVE THE MUSIC
LIBRARY'S AIMS. A LARGE RECORD LIBRARY AND GOOD TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT ARE
ESSENTIAL. SERIES OF SLIDES ACCOMPANYING THE MUSIC CREATE A BETTER ARTISTIC
AND HISTORIC ATMOSPHERE. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD OBSERVE ALL NEW EVENTS IN THE
MUSICAL WORLD, MAINTAINING CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIS AUDIENCE'S INTERESTS AND
DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP ACTIVITIES TO MAKE THE MUSIC SECTION A CENTRE
OF ATTRACTION.

THE COMPATIBILITY OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY' DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE AN
INTEGRATED SYSTEM, OR MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO TIE YOUR CURRENT
SYSTEMS TOGETHER. COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS CAN TREAT LIBRARY DATA AS AN
ORGANISATIONAL RESOURCE, REDUCE DATA DUPLICATION, IMPROVE MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION, REDUCE THE OVERHEAD REQUIRED FOR SEPARATE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS, AND
MAKE CONVERSION TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY MORE FEASIBLE. PLANNING FOR COMPUTER
SYSTEMS COMPATIBILITY MUST BE COORDINATED BY THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE
LIBRARY, WHO CAN REFEREE DEPARTMENTAL CONFLICTS.

THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 QUEBEC CORPORATION DES BIBLIOTHECAIRES
PROFESSIONNELS CONFERENCE, CONSIDERING HOW LIBRARIANS SHOULD APPROACH THE
INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE NECESSITY OF PLANNING IS ILLUSTRATED BY
EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS CANADIAN UNIVERSITY PROJECTS, AND THE SOPHISTICATED
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES OF TODAY COMPARED WITH THE EARLY EXPERIMENTAL PHASE IN
THE 1960S. PLANNING INVOLVES CONSIDERATION OF COSTS, BENEFITS AND OPERATIONAL
SATISFACTION IN THE PRELIMINARY PHASE, WHILE IMPLEMENTATION CHIEFLY INVOLVES
MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN RELATIONS, AND THE ADOPTION OF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO
CHANGE WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERING CURRENT
PRACTICES. LIBRARIANS ATTITUDES TO AUTOMATION VARY, BUT THE ESSENTIAL GOAL IS
IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING TECHNIQUES, NOT INNOVATION FOR ITS OWN SAKE, WITH THE
EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, EFFICIENT SERVICE PROVISION, AND HARMONIOUS
USER RELATIONS.

GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.

LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,
AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THE
BULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A
CERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONAL
LITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1 CATALOGUE CARD IS USED
FOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC
PREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN
1977. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT
GROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF CATALOGUING, DECREASE LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND REDUCE THE SIZE
OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES.

FROM THE WORLD OF MUSIC AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. DURING THE PREPARATION PERIOD
SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS APPEARED WHICH WERE USED IN COMPILING THE RULES. THE ISBD

HOME VIDEOTEX SERVICES' SOME LEGAL ISSUES.

REVISED VERSION OF PAPER PRESENTED AT A CONFERENCE, NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN
CANADIAN COMMUNICATIONS LAW AND POLICY, OTTAWA, JAN 80. THE PROVISION OF
VIDEOTEX SERVICES RAISES INTERESTING LEGAL ISSUES. THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF
REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO RADIO, TELEVISION, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL
LIKELY APPLY TO VIDEOTEX, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS MAY WELL
BE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA
COVERS INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTERS SUCH AS THAT WHICH WOULD BE CONTAINED
IN A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM. VIDEOTEX SERVICES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE CANADA WOULD BE
ABLE TO SIDESTEP CANADIAN PRIORITIES AND CANADIAN LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS. IT
HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT A WAY OF DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM WOULD BE TO REGULATE

ON THE INTRODUCTION OF VIEWDATA IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION.
PART 1.

'BILDSCHIRMTEXT' (BTX) IS A VIEWDATA SYSTEM SIMILAR TO PRESTEL WHICH IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN WEST GERMANY BY THE FEDERAL POST OFFICE. BTX REGISTERED USERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A
DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE
NECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A
TYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE
SYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
INFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.
FACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE
PROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL
PROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS
IMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND
T ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THIS NEW
SERVICE WITHOUT DUPLICATING EXISTING INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION SERVICES.

1975, BUT ARE STILL NOT WIDELY USED. AN EXAMPLE OF AN ON-LINE SERVICE USED IN
INDUSTRY IS DOKUMENTATION MASCHINENBAU (DOMA). THIS SERVICE HAS 17 USERS IN
INDUSTRY, MAINLY IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING BRANCHES BUT ALSO IN ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL AND CONSUMER GOODS CONCERNS. THE USERS ARE GENERALLY
CONFINED TO LARGE SCALE BUSINESSES EMPLOYING BETWEEN 1,000-25,000 PEOPLE. TO
MAKE EFFICIENT USE OF THE DOMA SERVICE IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE BEEN RUNNING A
SUCCESSFUL DOCUMENTATION DEPARTMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS, TO USE THE ON-LINE
SERVICE TO IMPLEMENT THE EXISTING INFORMATION ACTIVITY AND TO HAVE STAFF WHO
ARE KEPT UP TO DATE WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ON-LINE SERVICES. DOMA
PROVIDES PERSONNEL TRAINING AND HELPS WITH INSTALLATION OF HARDWARE BESIDES
PROVIDING ADVICE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD. THIS ASPECT OF ON-LINE SERVICES IS
VITAL AND TO UNDEREST IMATE LEADS TO UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS.

SEMANTIC LIMITATION IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.

THE BASIC PROBLEM IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE IS NOT
PROPERLY ADAPTED TO THAT OF THE AUTHOR. MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION, WHERE
WORDS WITH THE SAME ROOT ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE INVERTED FILE, IS A GOOD
ELIMINATOR OF NOISE AND INFORMATION LOSS, PROVIDING HIGH RECALL BUT LOW
PRECISION. PRECISION CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED, WHEREBY
SEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM THE MORPHOLOGICAL PERIPHERY OF THE ROOTS CAN BE
OBTAINED, WHICH CAN BE VERY RELEVANT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE PROCESS
INVOLVES RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DERIVATIVE SUFFIXES, PREFIXES AND COMPOSITE

HOW CAN WE USE LIBRARY RESEARCH?.

INTRODUCTIONS TO A DEBATE HELD AT THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING IN STOCKHOLM
AUG 80. O. HARBO DISTINGUISHES 4 TYPES OF LIBRARY RESEARCH AND THEIR USES. THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL AREA, I.E. RESEARCH
INTO ACQUISITION, STORING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. THE RESULTS CAN BE
USED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON
CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED
OUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M. OKKO POINTS TO THE DANGERS OF LIBRARY
RESEARCH WHICH IS CARRIED OUT FOR ITS USEFULNESS ONLY AND IIS DIRECTED BY
OUTSIDE INTERESTS. THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST
PERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A
MISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP MUST
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEM ORIENTATED AND CRITICAL, THUS AN
INTEREST IN LIBRARY RESEARCH CAN BE BUILT UP. INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS TO  THE

ALTERNATIVE MODES FOR PROVIDING GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP IN OHIO'
FINAL REPORT.

REPORT OF RESEARCH INITIATED DUE TO THE FACT THAT ONLY 2 OHIO LIBRARY SCHOOLS
ACCREDITED BY THE ALA ARE LOCATED IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO, MERELY 35 MILES APART.
THE STUDY INCLUDES A NEEDS ASSESSMENT, A RESOURCES ASSESSMENT, AND AN ANALYSIS
OF 4 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES-A NEW PROGRAMME MODEL, A PROGRAMME TRANSFER MODEL,
AN EXTENSION MODEL, AND A CONSORTIUM MODEL. AMONGST THE CONCLUSIONS ARE THE
FOLLOWING' NORTHEASTERN OHIO WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 40% OF THE PROFESSIONAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE STATE THROUGH 1990; A NEW GRADUATE SCHOOL WILL
NOT BE WARRANTED IN THE 1980S BECAUSE OF THE TIGHT JOB MARKET; AND TRANSFER OF
KENT'S PROGRAMME TO COLUMBUS WOULD LEAVE A SERIOUS GAP IN NORTHEASTERN OHIO.

BRANCH AND MOBILE LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, LYTHAM ST. ANNES, OCT-NOV
80. ALTHOUGH INCOME-GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL HELP THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE
SHORT TERM, THE RESULTANT REVENUE WILL ALWAYS BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION
OF THE BUDGET AND SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD PREJUDICE THE LIBRARY'S LONG TERM
SURVIVAL BY GIVING THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION. ONLY A MORE BUSINESS-LIKE,
PLANNED, BALANCED APPROACH THAN PREVIOUSLY PRACTISED CAN SAVE THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MARKETING CAN OFFER SUCH AN APPROACH. THE LIBRARY SHOULD TAILOR
SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY, TRAIN ITS STAFF TO BE

A CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON LEIMKUHLER'S 'EXACT' FORMULATION OF THE BRADFORD LAW.

ARGUES THAT POWERFUL OPERATIONAL RESEARCH TECHNIQUES OPERATE ONLY ON A SMALL
FRACTION OF THE STATISTICAL INFORMATION USUALLY PROVIDED BY THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. USES THE ARGUMENT TO ILLUSTRATE LEIMKUHLER'S RECENT CLAIM TO HAVE
FOUND AN 'EXACT' FIT TO BRADFORD'S LAW. AN ELEMENTARY THEOREM OF SHANNON
INFORMATION THEORY SHOWS THAT HIS NEW FUNCTION IS APPLIED TO ONLY 2.3% OF THE
STATISTICAL INFORMATION INHERENT IN THE BIBLIOGRAPHY HE CHOOSES AND THAT
BRADFORD'S ORIGINAL SIMPLE FORMULATION NOT ONLY FITS THIS SEGMENT BUT ALSO THE
WHOLE BIBLIOGRAPHY MORE CLOSELY THAN THE NEW FORMULATION. AS EVERY STATISTICAL
INFORMATION LOSS CAN BE MEASURED, IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT SOPHISTICATED
MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES CANNOT COMPENSATE FOR THE INFORMATION THEY SQUANDER.

SCOPAL.

THE 2ND SESSION OF THE STANDING CONFERENCE OF PACIFIC LIBRARIES (SCOPAL) WAS
HELD IN SUVA IN OCT 79. QUESTIONS WERE RAISED THEN AS TO WHETHER IT COULD
OPERATE AS A PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION WITHOUT A CONSTITUTION, MEMBERSHIP FEES
OR OVERT COMPETITION FOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS. ITS AIMS INCLUDE THE
ENCOURAGEMENT OF LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT, LIBRARY PROJECTS AND LIAISON WITHIN THE
PACIFIC REGION, AND TO PROVIDE A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FOR PROJECT WORKERS AND
WORKING GROUPS. ALTHOUGH IT CAN OPERATE ON ITS PRESENT LINES, SCOPAL REALLY
EMBODIES A 'SPIRIT OF REGIONALISM' WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME MOTIVATES
COOPERATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. ITS WEAKNESS IS THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN ITS MEMBERS. THE SPIRIT OF REGIONAL INFORMATION COOPERATION MUST TAKE
FLESH IN ORDER TO BE SEEN AND HEARD BY GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL BODIES AS
WELL AS BY THE LIBRARIANS AND COMMUNITIES WHICH SCOPAL SERVES.

LIBRARY NETWORKS-TRENDS AND ISSUES IN EVALUATION AND GOVERNANCE.

SPEECH PRESENTED AT ILLINOIS VALLEY LIBRARY SYSTEM MEETING, 6 DEC 79. STATE OF
THE ART OF US SYSTEMS AND NETWORKING, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO EVALUATION AND
ADMINISTRATION OF NETWORKS. THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FOR ALL LIBRARIES IS THAT
DEPENDENCY OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES ON EACH OTHER'S RESOURCES HAS BECOME A
CRITICAL DEPENDENCY. COSTS OF SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS ARE BECOMING MORE
SIGNIFICANT, AS IS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN SYSTEM OPERATION. THE RIGHT AND
RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES AS SYSTEM MEMBERS MUST BE SEEN FROM A
FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

THE ROLE OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES IN THE EMERGING NATIONAL NETWORK' CRITICAL
ISSUES.

SPECIAL LIBRARIES HAVE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN US NETWORK
ACTIVITIES AND TO CHOOSE AMONG INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING AUTOMATED AND MANUAL
SERVICES. THE BENEFITS OF NETWORKS/COOPERATIVES TO SPECIAL LIBRARIES AS WELL
AS REAL AND IMAGINED BARRIERS TO NETWORKING BY SPECIAL LIBRARIES ARE

ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF ASKING QUESTIONS. DIFFICULTIES IN INTERPRETATION OF
LIBRARY SURVEYS.

IN AN INVESTIGATION INTO HOW PEOPLE DIFFER IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF QUESTIONS
IN LIBRARY-USER SURVEYS, A RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS GROUP (STUDENTS ON A
METHODOLOGY COURSE AND THEIR ACQUAINTANCES) WAS ASKED TO COMPLETE A 2-PART
QUESTIONNAIRE. PART 1 DESCRIBED SITUATIONS THAT OFTEN OCCUR IN A LIBRARY AND
TYPES OF CONTACT WITH READING MATERIAL AND ASKED RESPONDENTS WHETHER THEY
WOULD CALL EACH 'LIBRARY USE'. PART 2 DESCRIBED THE FREQUENCY OF SITUATIONS
AND ASKED FOR AN APPROPRIATE ADVERB, SUCH AS 'SELDOM' OR 'OFTEN'. THE
RESPONSES SHOWED A SURPRISING VARIATION, AN INDICATION THAT THE QUESTIONNAIRE
PROCEDURE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS DISTORTION IF USED IN A QUANTITATIVE
INVESTIGATION.

ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS.

A PRELIMINARY STUDY TO PROBE THE VIEWS OF LIBRARIANS, RELATING TO THE ROLE OF
EVALUATION AND THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN A
10% SAMPLE OF LIBRARY AUTHORITIES IN ENGLAND IN SEPT 79-MAY 80. OPINIONS WERE
SOUGHT FROM CHIEF LIBRARIANS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OFFICERS AND SENIOR
MANAGEMENT. A WORKSHOP WAS SET UP TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE LEVELS OF
UNDERSTANDING OF AND COMMITMENT TO THE USE OF EVALUATIVE TECHNIQUES APPLIED TO
LIBRARY PERFORMANCE. 2 DETAILED CHECKLISTS RELATING TO EFFECTIVENESS AND
EVALUATIVE DESIGN WERE GENERATED AND USED AS A BASIS FOR THE WORK. THE NEED
FOR GUIDANCE ON TERMINOLOGY AND DIRECTION ON METHODS WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
BUT WAS DEEMED LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE IF IMPOSED BY AGENCIES EXTERNAL TO
LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

STUDY, JULY 1977.

STUDY CONCERNED WITH THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING INTER-LIBRARY
COMPARISONS. THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY INCLUDED' A SERIES OF VISITS TO ACADEMIC,
PUBLIC AND SPECIAL LIBRARIES UNDERTAKEN TO FAMILIARISE CIFC WITH THE WORKINGS
OF A SAMPLE OF LIBRARIES; EXAMINATION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH LIBRARIES MIGHT
BE COMPARED BY INTERFIRM COMPARISON METHODS; INDICATION OF POSSIBLE MEASURES

TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES' AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS.

INVESTIGATES THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS AND POSSIBLE MEANINGS OF THE TRADITIONAL
MEASURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN ORDER TO (1) UNDERSTAND THE
INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN
TRADITIONALLY MAINTAINED BY LIBRARIES, IDENTIFYING THOSE THAT ARE REDUNDANT
AND THOSE THAT ARE UNIQUE; (2) DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OF THESE MEASURES
ON ALL OTHER MEASURES; AND (3) UNDERSTAND THE VALIDITY OF THESE MEASURES,
SINGLY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHERS, AS INDICATORS OF LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.
THE DATA USED IS THAT COLLECTED IN THE 1974 US PUBLIC LIBRARIES SURVEY, WHICH
ASKED FOR DATA ON 60 MEASURES.

THE USE OF EMPIRICAL STANDARDS IN ASSESSING PUBLIC LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.

REPORTS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN 1977-78 IN WHICH MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS
WAS USED TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF (MAINLY) RESOURCE VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING
THE LEVEL OF CIRCULATION IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. CONCLUDES
THAT' THE LEVELS OF THE VARIABLES EXPLAIN VERY HIGH PROPORTIONS OF THE
VARIANCE OF LIBRARY USE; RESEARCHERS ARE NOT YET JUSTIFIED IN CALLING THE
OBSERVED RELATIONSHIPS INPUT-OUTPUT FUNCTIONS; AND, DESPITE THIS, THE STRENGTH
OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDES A POWERFUL TOOL FOR COMPARING PERFORMANCES OF
LIBRARIES AND FOR PREDICTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF A GIVEN LIBRARY.

COLLECTION SIZE AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCHES.

DESCRIBES THE LOGAN SQUARE EXPERIMENTAL BOOK BRANCH OF CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY.
THIS BRANCH LIBRARY IS AIMING TO PROVIDE A BETTER SERVICE TO EXISTING USERS
AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO 'OUTREACH' TO THE COMMUNITY. STAFF RESOURCES HAVE
DECREASED DURING THE EXPERIMENT AND THE BOOK BUDGET IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE
OF SIMILARLY-SIZED LIBRARIES. IN 1978-79 (THE EXPERIMENT'S 1ST YEAR), THE
BOOKSTOCK WAS INCREASED FROM 45,000 TO 66,500 VOLUMES (MAINLY BY ACCEPTING
DISCARDS FROM OTHER BRANCHES) AND A MAGAZINE COLLECTION WAS STARTED. AFTER
DECLINING FOR 10 YEARS, CIRCULATION INCREASED BY 19% IN 1979. IT IS TOO EARLY
TO ANALYSE THE EXPERIMENT'S RESULTS, BUT THE FUTURE LOOKS GOOD. PERHAPS THIS
IS A TRUE MEASURE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS.

LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN MEETING INFORMATION CONSUMER'S NEEDS.

PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO LIBRARY EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS
OF MEETING CITIZENS' INFORMATION NEEDS. RESIDENTS FROM 2,400 RANDOMLY-SELECTED
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES OF THE USA PARTICIPATED IN 15-MINUTE
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, JULY-OCT 79. IT APPEARS THAT THEY INFREQUENTLY CONSULT
LIBRARIES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE IN WORK OR NON-WORK SITUATIONS. OF THE
17% USING LIBRARIES, THE MAJORITY (11%) DO NOT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LIBRARY AS AN INFORMATION PROVIDER. TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITORS WITH
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LIBRARIES MUST PUBLICISE RESOURCES AND SERVICES
MORE EFFECTIVELY, IMPROVE DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITY, AND IDENTIFY AND
REDUCE BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED BY THE CITIZEN WHEN ATTEMPTING TO GAIN ACCESS TO
INFORMATION.

PUBLIC LIBRARY, MINNESOTA. 245 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED AND 208 USABLE
ONES WERE RETURNED. THE SURVEY WAS BASED ON A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WHICH TREATS
USER SATISFACTION AS A FUNCTION OF (1) THE USER'S DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS,
(2) THE VARIOUS USES MADE OF THE LIBRARY BY THE USER, AND (3) THE USER'S
EVALUATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LIBRARY USED.

AN EVALUATIVE, HOLISTIC, AND USER-ORIENTED APPROACH TO ASSESSING AND
MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY IN ITS SETTING.

DESCRIBES RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN TO BROADEN THE THEORETICAL BASE ON WHICH
EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES CAN BE DETERMINED, TO TRANSLATE FINDINGS
INTO OPERATIONAL TERMS, AND TO TEST OPERATIONALLY A SYSTEM OF ASSESSING AND
MONITORING EFFECTIVENESS ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS. THE METHODOLOGY
DEVELOPED WAS CENTRED ON A LIBRARY USER QUESTIONNAIRE IN WHICH THE USERS WERE
ASKED TO RATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE, LEVEL OF USER SATISFACTION, USER
BENEFIT, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH LIBRARY SERVICE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS
TESTED IN A COLLEGE, WITH PROMISING RESULTS. THIS LINE OF RESEARCH IS
CONTINUING.
