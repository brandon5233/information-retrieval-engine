CHANGES DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS (1969-1978) IN THE ACADEMIC LIBRARY DECISION
PROCESS FOR THE PLACEMENT AND RENEWAL OF SCHOLARLY PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1969-78. THROUGH MOST OF THE DECADE, THE LIBRARIES RELIED ON
A SERIES OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OR HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,
SHIFTING FROM MONOGRAPHIC TO SERIALS EXPENDITURE AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATES.
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE THEY BEEN FORCED TO TURN TO CONSORTIA AND
NETWORKS TO ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURES ON THEM. THE LIBRARIES MUST FACE THEIR
PROBLEMS SQUARELY IN THE 1980S AND PRODUCE LEADERS WITH THE ASTUTENESS,
COURAGE, AND PERSUASIVENESS TO MAKE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEMS. ONLY THEN, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCORD, WILL
ACADEMIC LIBRARY COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES MOVE FORWARD MORE RAPIDLY AND
PURPOSEFULLY.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LIBRARY'S BIBLIOGRAPHIC CONTROL SYSTEM. ONLY IN LARGER

DESCRIBES A METHOD DEVELOPED AT THE PRINCE WILLIAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, MANASSAS,
VIRGINIA, FOR MEASURING THE RATE OF AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS SOUGHT BY THE
PUBLIC FROM ITS COLLECTIONS. RELATES THIS METHOD TO TRADITIONAL PUBLIC LIBRARY
STANDARDS AND PREVIOUS AVAILABILITY RESEARCH. AVAILABILITY RATE COULD BE USED
AS A PERFORMANCE STANDARD, MEASURING QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERED AND
INDICATING A LIBRARY'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION.

LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ON
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TO
BE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,
NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BE
SUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THE
LIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,
OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
IS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC IN
BROADER BASED JOURNALS.

SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.

BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTEN
DISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCE
STRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONAL
BOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELY
AGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN
ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USE
VARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONAL
OBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOST
EFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENT
DOES NOT EXIST. IN DETERMINING IF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT HAS A PLACE IN A
PARTICULAR LIBRARY ORGANISATION, LIBRARY PLANNERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED A BOUT
NATURAL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND SHOULD TRY TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN
COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY ACROSS ORGANISATIONAL BARRIERS.

HAVE ALREADY BEEN ORDERED AS PART OF A SERIES. CHOICE OF BOOKSELLER IS ALSO
CRUCIAL. OTHER PROBLEMS CONCERN CALCULATION OF PRICE INCREASES AND THE USE OF
EXCHANGES. THE MECHANISATION OF ROUTINES, SUCH AS CATALOGUING AND ACCOUNTING
AND THE AUTOMATION OF BOOKSELLERS' DATA HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR ACQUISITION. NEW

ACADEMIC LIBRARY COLLECTIONS HAVE, HISTORICALLY, BEEN SELECTED BY THE FACULTY
OF THE INSTITUTION WHICH THEY LIBRARY SERVES. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MUCH
RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT HAS DEVOLVED UPON LIBRARIANS WHO ARE
EAGER TO RETAIN AND AMPLIFY THEIR ROLE IN THIS AREA. ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN
FAVOUR OF LODGING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBLITY WITH LIBRARIANS ARE,
HOWEVER, LESS THAN CONVINCING AND IGNORE IMPORTANT REALITIES TO MAKE THEIR
CASE. LIBRARIANS OFTEN CONFUSE THE ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY
FOR SUCH SELECTION. ARGUES THAT BOOK SELECTION IS MORE PROPERLY AND MORE
ADEQUATELY DONE BY FACULTY MEMBERS THAN LIBRARIANS, AND SUGGESTS A WAY OF
DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN ENCOUNTERED WHEN FACULTY ARE

WHICH IT HAS OWNERSHIP AND THE CONDITION OF SUCH OWNERSHIP; NO GOVERNMENT
RECORD MAY BE DESTROYED OR ALTERED WITHOUT CONSENT FROM THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST
OR HIS DESIGNATE; AND THE DOMINION ARCHIVIST MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECLARE

FIXED-LENGTH FIELDS WITH A-CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC CONTROL NUMBER. FIELDS
INCLUDE FREQUENCY, ISSUES PER VOLUME AND PRICE, AND EACH ENTRY MAY BE TERMED
'ALIVE' OR 'INACTIVE'. LIBRARY RECORDS WERE THEN CONVERTED TO MACHINE-READABLE
FORM AND MAY NOW BE SORTED BY LOCATION, TYPE AND SUBJECT/DEPARTMENT. THE

IN 1978, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITS
CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
FULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERY
SUCCESSFUL. A 5-POINT PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED' (1) EVALUATE PRESENT OPERATION
AND VARIOUS TASKS; (2) ANALYSE THESE TASKS TO DETECT NON-PRODUCTIVE AREAS OR
AREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4) DOCUMENT THE NEW
PROCEDURES; AND (5) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THE
FACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHER
TASK. WHEN THIS TIME WAS CUT DOWN THROUGH THE USE OF THE MARC DISTRIBUTION
SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE SYSTEM PROVED SUITABLY STREAMLINED TO
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT.

OF INFORMATION IS THEREFORE VERY LIMITED. THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE POSSIBILITY
OF USING COLOUR AS A WAY OF CODING INFORMATION. 7 COLOURS, INCLUDING WHITE,
ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEY ARE NOT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AND THIS HAS IMPORTANT
IMPLICATIONS FOR LEGIBILITY. BEARING IN MIND THE CONSTRAINTS AND FREEDOM
OFFERED BY THIS KIND OF DISPLAY, WAYS OF PRESENTING TEXT, TABLES, INDEXES AND

PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES

RESOLUTION OF PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES IN LIBRARY EDUCATION IS THE NEED TO
ARTICULATE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SELF-APPROPRIATED LEARNING, SO THAT AN
UNDERSTANDING OF THEORY, GROUNDED IN PRACTICAL TASKS, ARISES FROM THE LOGICAL
PROCESSES OF A SECURE AND RELIABLE PEDAGOGY. THE WORK IS INTENDED FOR LIBRARY
EDUCATORS, STUDENTS AND PRACTISING PROFESSIONALS.

THE PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF LIBRARIANS AT UNIVERSITY LEVEL.
     
THE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS HAS NOT IMPROVED IN ITALY DURING THE
LAST 50 YEARS. UNIVERSITY REFORM HAS COMPLETELY IGNORED THE PROBLEM OF LIBRARY
ORGANISATION IN RESPECT OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING. LIBRARIANS SHOULD TAKE
DEGREE COURSES IN THE SPECIFIC DISCIPLINES OF THE CULTURAL AREAS SERVED BY THE
LIBRARIES IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO WORK. PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION CANNOT BE
CONSIDERED COMPLETE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. LIBRARIANS LACKING
THE CAPACITY TO ORGANISE A LIBRARY ON TRADITIONAL LINES WILL NOT PROFIT MUCH
FROM THE ASSISTANCE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD RATIONALISE
ITS OWN LIBRARIES AND CONCENTRATE ITS INTERNAL SERVICES AT ALL LEVELS ON
SATISFYING THE REQUESTS OF ALL POTENTIAL READERS.

COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE BORAS LIBRARY HIGH SCHOOL, SWEDEN FOR 1979-80.
THE CHANGING FORMS OF THE EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP AND THE QUESTION OF AN
EDUCATION FOR TUTOR LIBRARIANS ARE DISCUSSED. WHEN REVIEWING THE CAPACITY OF
THE SCHOOL IT IS CLEAR THAT IT HAS NOT RESPONDED WELL TO THE CHANGING LABOUR
MARKET, SOMETIMES PRODUCING OVER-, SOMETIMES UNDERCAPACITY. CRITICISES THE
PLANS FOR SEVERAL SHORTER TRAINING COURSES AS THEY MIGHT REDUCE INTEREST IN
THE 2-YEAR LIBRARIANSHIP COURSE. DISCUSSES ALSO WHETHER THE EDUCATION FOR
LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE GENERAL WITH SPECIALISATION AFTER A FOUNDATION COURSE,
AS THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES WANT, OR WHETHER SPECIALISED COURSES SHOULD BE
AVAILABLE EARLIER, AND ARGUES FOR MORE LIBRARIANS WITH SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF
ADMINISTRATION, INFORMATION WORK, AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, WHICH CANNOT BE

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION FOR THE DIPLOMA IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE

AND THE SYLLABUS IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY IN CONSULTATION WITH STUDENTS AND WITH
STAFF FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES. IN ADDITION THE VARIETY OF POSTS IN ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES OPEN TO STUDENTS COMPLETING THE COURSE MAKES IT IMPRACTICAL TO SUIT
THE SYLLABUS TO A SINGLE TYPE OF LIBRARY. IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT TOO LITTLE IS

BETTER EDUCATION IN IMMIGRANT MATTERS FOR LIBRARIANS IS WANTED.
     
TRADITIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES FOR ESTABLISHED USER GROUPS ARE STILL THE NORM
IN SWEDISH LIBRARIES, AND IMMIGRANT SERVICES ARE CARRIED OUT AS HUMANITARIAN
AID WITH CONSEQUENT LOW STATUS. IF DEMAND FOR IMMIGRANT LITERATURE WERE
TREATED LIKE THAT FOR COOK BOOKS OR STAMP CATALOGUES A LESS EMOTIONAL ATTITUDE
WOULD BE ACHIEVED. LIBRARIES MUST HELP IMMIGRANTS TO RETAIN THEIR MOTHER
TONGUE AS WELL AS TO LEARN SWEDISH. THERE ARE GOVERNMENTAL GUIDELINES ON
STOCKING OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AND CHANNELS OF SUPPLY ARE AVAILABLE, BUT
COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING IS NEEDED. MORE CONTACT WITH
IMMIGRANT ORGANISATIONS AND BETTER EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS ARE NECESSARY. WHAT
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IS LARGELY DUE TO THE WORK OF THE SWEDISH LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION'S WORKING PARTY ON IMMIGRANT AND MINORITY QUESTIONS.

IN 1975 SHOWED THAT 1/3 OF HOSPITALS SURVEYED HAD SOME FORM OF LIBRARY. THE
PROVISION OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN DUTCH HOSPITALS IS HINDERED BY INADEQUATE
BOOKFUNDS, STAFF AND ACCOMMODATION. FURTHERMORE, IN THE SMALLER HOSPITALS
DOCTORS ARE TOO BUSY WITH ROUTINE WORK TO USE LIBRARY SERVICES. SMALLER
HOSPITALS COULD PROVIDE MEDICAL 'CORE' LIBRARIES OF BASIC TEXTBOOKS AND
PERIODICALS AT MINIMAL COST. SUCH A MEDICAL CORE LIBRARY WAS FORMED IN 1973 AT
THE PRINCESS IRENE HOSPITAL IN ALMELO AND BY 1979 THE LIBRARY CONTAINED 266
BOOKS AND 6 PERIODICAL TITLES.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO LIBRARY SERVICES FOR THE DISABLED.
DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE DISABLED IN A
PRESENT AND FUTURE LIBRARY CONTEXT. LIBRARIES MUST ASSIST HANDICAPPED PEOPLE
TO TAKE PART IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY ON EQUAL TERMS
WITH EVERYONE ELSE, BUT THIS MEANS THAT THEY MUST HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE
INFORMATION AND EXPRESSIVE HUMAN EXPERIENCE CAUGHT BY THE PRINTED WORD. A
TOTAL OR PARTIAL READING HANDICAP WILL HINDER THIS ACCESS. TO THE LIBRARY
FALLS THE TASK OF BREAKING DOWN THE BARRIERS WHICH PREVENT THOSE WITH A
READING HANDICAP FROM GAINING ACCESS TO THE MESSAGE CONTAINED BY WORDS IN

HOW SHALL THE LIBRARY APPROACH THE IMMIGRANTS?.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULE
OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THAT
PART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION AND
PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD A
CENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THE
CHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUST
ALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVE
LITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL AND A BETTER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ARE NECESSARY. THE EFFORTS OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY CATERING FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS MUST, APART FROM

FOREIGN ECONOMIC LITERATURE AND ITS INFORMATION VALUE.
     
FOREIGN ECONOMIC LITERATURE AVAILABLE IN BULGARIAN LIBRARIES IS USUALLY
CLASSIFIED AS NON-MARXIST PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BEFORE 1900. BETWEEN 1900-45
ONLY A FEW MARXIST PUBLICATIONS CAN BE TRACED. AFTER WORLD WAR II, HOWEVER,
THE SHARE OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE BASED ON MARXISM INCREASED RAPIDLY. THE CYRIL
AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC
LITERATURE IN THE COUNTRY CONSISTING MAINLY OF REFERENCE MATERIAL. THE MAIN
TOPIC AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA LIBRARY IS ECONOMIC HISTORY AND SOME UNIQUE
PUBLICATIONS CAN BE FOUND THERE, FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THE SOVIET
UNION. ECONOMIC THEORY IS REPRESENTED ABOVE ALL AT THE LIBRARY OF THE
BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. ECONOMIC COLLEGES IN VARNA AND SVISCOV CATER
FOR THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME SPECIALISED COLLECTIONS
AND CATALOGUES AT THE BULGARIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE CENTRAL
AGRICULTURAL LIBRARY, ESTABLISHED SOME TIME AG O. THE MAJORITY OF FOREIGN
ECONOMIC LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN, ENGLISH, GERMAN AND FRENCH. ADVOCATES THE

ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION' A NETWORK PERSPECTIVE.
     
DISCUSSES WHY THERE ARE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES
AND PRODUCTS (BY BOTH COMMERCIAL AND NON-PROFIT VENDORS OF AUTOMATION) TO MEET
THE NEEDS OF LIBRARIES; WHY AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING AND PREPARATION, WHOLE
SUB-SYSTEMS DO NOT FUNCTION OR PERFORM AT UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR PRICES; AND
WHY, IN THE CONTINUING EXCHANGE BETWEEN REGIONAL LIBRARY NETWORKS AND NATIONAL
COMPANIES AND AGENCIES, THERE ARE SO FEW ACHIEVEMENTS IN COOPERATION, JOINT
DEVELOPMENT AND FUNDING, AND CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. VENDORS MUST STOP
USING PROFESSIONAL MARKETERS IN PLANNING DEVELOPMENTS; THEY MUST COMMUNICATE
DIRECTLY WITH LIBRARIES INSTEAD. THEY SHOULD ALSO COOPERATE AMONGST THEMSELVES
AND REALISE THE POTENTIAL OF WORKING WITH LIBRARY NETWORKS RATHER THAN
INDIVIDUAL NETWORK MEMBERS.

THE ROLE OF THE NETWORK IN AUTOMATED ACQUISITIONS.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITA (AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION) INSTITUTE. EXAMINES NON-PROFIT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC NETWORKS TO ASSESS WHY THEY OFFER, OR PLAN TO OFFER ACQUISITIONS
SERVICES, WHAT MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS THEY CAN MAKE, AND THE ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES OF NETWORK ACQUISITIONS SYSTEMS FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES.
NETWORKS CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITIONS
FUNCTIONS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, AND THE NETWORKS CAN PROVIDE BOTH ACQUISITIONS
AND IN-PROCESS CONTROL OVER MATERIALS, THUS ALLOWING A LIBRARY TO OPERATE MORE
EFFICIENTLY WITH IMPROVED INTERNAL CONTROLS. AS A NETWORK SYSTEM WILL DISPLAY
MEMBER HOLDINGS, COOPERATIVE ACQUISITIONS AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN WILL ALSO BE

REVISED VERSION OF A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON NATIONAL

FAVOURED DECENTRALISED NETWORKS RATHER THAN CENTRALISED RESOURCE LIBRARIES. US

COMPUTER UTILITIES. THESE COMPUTER NETWORKS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTED NOT
DUPLICATED BY CENTRAL RESOURCE LIBRARIES; WITH THE NATIONAL PERIODICALS CENTER
EFFECTIVELY SHELVED, THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH LIBRARIES COULD ASSUME A MORE
DYNAMIC ROLE. COMMERCIAL VENDORS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT ARE AN IMPORTANT
ELEMENT IN DOCUMENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS. THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE CONVENTIONAL

CLIMATE ZONES; BUT IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THESE DANGERS ARE INCREASED,
SOME OF THEM DRAMATICALLY, IN WARM DAMP CLIMATES. IN TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL

FIRST, DO NO HARM' GIVING ADVICE ABOUT PHOTO-CONSERVATION.
     
IN 1979 IN THE USA, OVER 10 BILLION EXPOSURES WERE MADE BY 45 BILLION CAMERAS,
BUT MOST OF THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WILL EVENTUALLY BE LOST, THROWN AWAY,
SELF-DESTRUCT OR BE FORGOTTEN BEFORE ANYONE EVEN THINKS OF PRESERVING THEM FOR
POSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SO
PERHAPS PRESERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS' ORIGINATORS. ONLY
NOW IS SOME EFFORT BEING MADE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMES FOR THE FORMAL TRAINING
OF CONSERVATORS, AND MOST AMATEURS STILL WANT CHEAP, QUICK AND EASY SOLUTIONS.
IT FALLS TO LIBRARIANS, ARCHIVISTS AND CURATORS, THEREFORE TO MAKE USEFUL
INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT AND TO BE PREPARED TO
CARRY IT TO THOSE WHO DO NOT. PRESENTS A LIST OF USEFUL AND RECENT SOURCE

ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THE
FLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BE

TO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;
ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. IN

A KNOWLEDGE-BASED LITERATURE GUIDE SYSTEM-A NEW APPROACH TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL.
     
PRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL BASED ON A SEMANTIC MODEL FOR
NATURAL LANGUAGE. THE CONTENT OF A DOCUMENT IS REPRESENTED USING THE
HIERARCHICAL MODEL OF KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION, ITS SENTENCES BEING TRANSLATED
INTO LOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS WHICH ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE AS
AN ORGANISED KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE. QUERIES ARE ALSO IN NATURAL LANGUAGE, FROM
WHICH RETRIEVAL COMMANDS ARE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED. ANSWERS ARE SYNTHESISED
FROM THE RESULTS OF RETRIEVAL. A WORKING SYSTEM CALLED LGS (LITERATURE GUIDE
SYSTEM) HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED. THIS CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS BASED ON THE
INTEGRATED ABSTRACTS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. EXAMPLES USING LGS ARE
PRESENTED.

THE DUALITY OF CLASSIFICATION' TAXONOMY AND MERONOMY.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. IN THE
CONTEXT OF NATURAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT, CLASSIFICATION IS
VIEWED AS THE GROUPING OF OBJECTS IN CLASSES (TAXONS) AND AS THE FINDING OF
COMMON STRUCTURES (ARCHETYPES) WITHIN THE OBJECTS. AN ARCHETYPE IS A STRUCTURE
OF PARTS (MERONS). THE CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE CAN BE REPRESENTED AS AN
INTERACTIVE PROCESS WHEREBY THE GROUPING BY TAXONS ALTERNATES WITH THE
IDENTIFICATION OF TAXON ARCHETYPES, WHICH ARE USED AGAIN TO UPDATE THE TAXON
COMPOSITION. PRESENTS A MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE TAXONOMIC GROUPING OF OBJECTS AND THEIR PARTITIONING INTO MERONS, WITH
SPECIAL MENTION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION.

SOME SIGNIFICANT RESULTS OF CURRENT CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH IN INDIA.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A SECTION ON CURRENT TRENDS IN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH. BASED
ON THE PAPER 'A GENERAL THEORY OF SIL, POPSI AND CLASSAURUS', SUBMITTED FOR
DISCUSSION AT THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH FORUM, MINNEAPOLIS,
OCT 79. A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF 3 INDIAN CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS. A
GENERAL THEORY OF SUBJECT INDEXING LANGUAGE (SIL) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
LOGICAL ABSTRACTION OF THE STRUCTURES OF OUTSTANDING SILS. THE LANGUAGE OF
POSTULATE-BASED PERMUTED SUBJECT INDEXING (POPSI) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF SILS FORMING PART OF THE GENERAL
THEORY. THE CLASSAURUS HAS ALSO BEEN FORMULATED; THIS IS A FACETED SYSTEMATIC
SCHEME OF HIERARCHICAL CLASSIFICATION HAVING ALL THE NECESSARY ATTRIBUTES OF A
CONVENTIONAL THESAURUS, EXCLUDING THE NUMERATION OF OTHER RELATED TERMS AND IS
ESPECIALLY MEANT TO FACILITATE THE USE OF POPSI.

FILE AS A DEPENDABLE ARCHIVIST.
     
THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART OF INFORMATION PROCESSING TENDS TO LINK CERTAIN
CAPABILITIES (SUCH AS PROTECTION OF DATA INTEGRITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY AND
MONITORING USER/DATA INTERACTIONS) WITH LARGE DATA BASE SYSTEMS. THIS IS MOST
UNFORTUNATE, SINCE SUCH CAPABILITIES ARE FREQUENTLY VITAL FOR MODEST

THE IMPACT OF WARFARE ON THE RATE OF INVENTION' A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF
UNITED STATES ACTIVITY.
     
THE OUTBREAK OF WAR IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO SHIFT THE FIELDS IN WHICH RESEARCH
IS CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT, MILITARY CONFLICT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CREDITED
WITH BEING THE CATALYST WHICH HAS CAUSED DECISIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. IT
IS ALSO GENERALLY SUGGESTED THAT WARFARE HAS A SYSTEMATIC IMPACT ON THE
INTENSITY OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY. MOST SCHOLARS HAVE CLAIMED THAT WARS INCREASE
INVENTIVENESS, ALTHOUGH A FEW ARGUE THAT CONFLICT IS A HINDERANCE TO RESEARCH.
THIS QUESTION HAS NOT RECEIVED EXTENSIVE EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION. USING US DATA,
A BASIC PATTERN IS REPEATEDLY OBSERVED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF A
WAR, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INVENTIVENESS, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A
MARKED SURGE. THE AVERAGE NET RESULT IS A VIRTUAL NEGATION OF THE 2 TRENDS.

AFFORD TO PUBLISH. FURTHER, THEY WERE ASKED WHETHER THEY HAD CONSIDERED THE
OPTION OF ON-DEMAND (OD) PUBLISHING AND WHAT FEATURES AN ON-DEMAND SYSTEM

BOOK CLUBS AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS BOOKCLUBS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SEVERELY CRITICISED BY AUTHORS
FOR PAYING MUCH SMALLER ROYALTIES THAN THE NORMAL BOOKTRADE. THE 1ST BOOKCLUB
IN THE NETHERLANDS WAS FOUNDED IN 1937 AND THERE ARE NOW 6 REGISTERED CLUBS
WITH A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF APPROX. 1 1/2 MILLION MEMBERS. THE MARKET SHARE OF
THE BOOKCLUBS IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS RISEN FROM 2% IN 1966 TO 24% IN 1980. THE
REMOVAL OF THE COLLECTIVE PRICE AGREEMENT ON BOOKS WOULD ALSO BE DISASTROUS
FOR THE SMALLER BOOKSHOPS AND PUBLISHERS AND FOR LESSER-KNOWN AUTHORS.
BOOKSELLERS AND PUBLISHERS MUST NOW COME TO A TRADING ARRANGEMENT WITH THE
BOOKCLUBS. IT IS, HOWEVER, FORTUNATE THAT THE LARGER BOOKCLUBS ARE THEMSELVES
